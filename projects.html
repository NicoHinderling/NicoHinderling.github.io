				<p><a href= 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim_%28pencil_game%29' class= "has-success">Sim</a> is a game where players take turns drawing lines from point to point. The object of the game is to avoid making a triangle with your own lines.<br><br><br>Sim Pencil AI was a project that originally began in one of my Computer Science courses at Boston University during my first year. While most of the things we had assigned were less exciting, I found the concept of Artifical Intelligence fastinating. This was also a wonderful example for applications of MinMax trees!</p>

			<div class="page-header"><h3>Methodology<h3></div>

			<p>We Used the <a href="http://www.idolondemand.com/developer/apis">Idol On Demand api</a> from HP to determine aggregate sentiment. The sentiment is a value between -1 and 1, 1 being "I LOVE BITCOIN" to -1 being "SELL YOUR BITCOIN NOW". Each post over the historical data was summed to get a daily correct value. Our data was taken from the reddit bitcoin community.</p>

			<p>The historical bitcoin prices were retrieved from the <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/docs/api/overview">coinbase API</a>: </p>

  			<div class="page-header"><h3>Results<h3></div>

			<div class="page-header"><h3>Data<h3></div>
			<p>Feel free to use our data. There are two text files that have json data dumped straight in them. Or you can use the csv file if you'd like an easier file format. Please attribute your work to <a href="https://github.com/sean-smith/BitcoinSentiment">this github repo</a>.</p>
